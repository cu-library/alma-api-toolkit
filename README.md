# alma-api-toolkit

The Alma API toolkit is a set of tasks which run against the Alma API. It is a replacement for a series of Python scripts which all did similar things:

1. Collect identifiers in an Alma set. 
2. Run a task against all those identifiers. 

Those scripts worked well for smaller sets, but were too unreliable for larger sets.
